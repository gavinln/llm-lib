# Phidata samples

[Phidata][100] is a framework for building AI assistants with memory, knowledge and tools.

[100]: https://docs.phidata.com/introduction

To turn a large language model (LLM) into an AI assistant we need to extend it with memory, knowledge and tools.

- Memory: Stores chat history in a database to enable LLMs to have a long-term conversation
- Knowledge: Stores information in a vector database to provide LLMs with context
- Tools: Enables LLMs to take actions such as querying a database, calling an API, etc...
